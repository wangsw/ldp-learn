## A library for local differential private data analyses.


Local differential privacy (LDP)  is the state-of-the-art notion for data privacy, emerges as a remedy for data privacy issue in this big data era.  LDP is fexlexible, lightweight and easy to implement for production envrionments. One complelling property of LDP is that the data owner could have full control of their data without trust of any other parties. 

This reposity provides serveral LDP mechanisms intended for user/client data analyses, including distribution estimation and mean estimation (for now) on categorical data, set-valued data and numerical data.


## Supported mechanism
1. binary randomized response (brr)[3] for categorical data distribution estimation.
2. multinomial randomzed response (mrr)[3] for categorical data distribution estimation.
3. k-subset mechanism (k-subset)[3] for categorical data distribution estimation.


4. binary randomized repsonse for set-valued data (brrset, RAPPOR) [1] distribution estimation
5. privset mechanism (privset)[2] for set-valued data distribution estimation.
